# Double Pendulum Simulation
* A full description of this project may be seen <a href="https://freddyox.github.io/blog/double-pendulum/">here</a>, or see a 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuhPbDQs3eY&feature=youtu.be">video of the simulation</a>.
* The equations of motion are numerically solved using the RK4 method.
* The previous positions of the pendula are visualized using a tracer method, which dissolves as time goes on to avoid cluster.
* The program makes use of <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML multimedia libraries</a> for visualization, here is a screen shot using a rainbow
tracer for the second pendulum:
